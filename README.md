# What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?

## Background
The mean normal body temperature was held to be 37 degrees C or 98.6 degrees F for more than 120 years since it was first conceptualized and reported by Carl Wunderlich in a famous 1868 book. But, is this value statistically correct?

## Conclusions
### What is the True Normal Human Body Temperature?
The true body normal human body temperature is 98.25 Â± 1.44 degrees F with 95% confidence.
   
### Is the distribution of body temperatures normal?
For this dataset, yes.
    
### Is the sample size large?
Assuming that the population size is about 1 million people, we can say that it is with 90% confidence.
    
### Are the observations independent?
Yes, body temperatures are independent to heartrate.
    
### Is the true population mean really 98.6 degrees F?
No. The true population is less than 98.6 degrees F with 99% confidence.
    
### At what temperature should we consider someone's temperature to be "abnormal"?
Statistically, anything above or below 96.81 to 99.68 degrees F at 95% confidence.
    
### Is there at difference between male and female body temperature?
Yes. Females are warmer than males with 95% confidence. 

## Discussion
37 degrees C or 98.6 degrees F is a very fair estimate for a study published in the 1800's. However, with all of the statistics that we have today, we can do better than that. We found the true normal body temperature with confidence. We ensured that our data was normally distributed. We checked that our sample size was large enough to represent at least 1 million people. We concluded that less than the published 98.6 degrees F, with confidence. We also found what we can consider "abnormal" temperatures. Finally, we even concluded that females are warmer than males. This study is showing how we can consistently make improvements to research studies in the past. Even though the past estimate was very close, we were able to make it even better with what we have today.
